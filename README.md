# CAN-SessionKey
This repo includes the hardware specs, code, and documentation for evaluating SKDC and SSKT, two session key distribution protocols for CAN bus. Background on CAN bus, authentication and session keys, and detailed protocol workflow can be found in our ACSAC 2020 (Dec 7-11, 2020) paper <em>Session Key Distribution Made Practical for CAN and CAN-FD Message Authentication.</em>

## Introduction
The code consists of two independent parts: 1) A benchmark evaluation procedure for each of the protocol steps and an extrapolation analysis program. 2) A prototype implementation of SKDC and SSKT, along with hardware specification and evaluation procedures.

## Part 1: Benchmark Evaluation

## Part 2: Prototype Implementation and Evaluation
This part contains the implemention of both SKDC and SSKT protocols. For both, we take
